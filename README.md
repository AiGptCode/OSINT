⭐ Project Review: OSINT Data Collection Tool ⭐



This project provides a foundational tool for OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) data collection, using Python to aggregate information from social media platforms, search engines, and WHOIS data. The code is modular and easy to follow, making it an excellent choice for developers interested in exploring ethical data gathering and OSINT techniques.

Pros

	•	Modular Design: Each function is encapsulated for a specific purpose (e.g., Google search, Twitter search), making it easy to expand and modify.
	•	Error Handling: Thoughtful error management with try-except blocks allows the tool to handle failures gracefully, making it more reliable.
	•	Flexible Output: The JSON-formatted output structure is convenient for logging, exporting, and visualizing results.
	•	Good Documentation: Inline comments and function descriptions make it easy to understand the code flow, even for beginners.
